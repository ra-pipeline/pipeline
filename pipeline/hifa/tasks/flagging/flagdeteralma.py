        Args:
            context: Pipeline context object containing state information.

            vis: The list of input MeasurementSets. Defaults to the list of
                MeasurementSets defined in the pipeline context.

            output_dir: Output directory.
                Defaults to None, which corresponds to the current working directory.

            flagbackup: Back up any pre-existing flags.

            autocorr: Flag autocorrelation data.

            shadow: Flag shadowed antennas.

            tolerance: Amount of antenna shadowing tolerated, in meters. A positive number
                allows antennas to overlap in projection. A negative number forces antennas
                apart in projection. Zero implies a distance of radius_1+radius_2 between
                antenna centers.

            scan: Flag a list of specified scans.

            scannumber: A string containing a comma delimited list of scans to be
                flagged.

                Example: ``scannumber='3,5,6'``

            intents: A string containing a comma delimited list of intents against
                which the scans to be flagged are matched.

                Example: ``intents='*BANDPASS*`'``

            edgespw: Flag the edge spectral window channels.

            fracspw: Fraction of channels to flag at both edges of TDM spectral windows.

            fracspwfps: Fraction of channels to flag at both edges of ACA TDM
                spectral windows that were created with the earlier (original)
                implementation of the frequency profile synthesis (FPS) algorithm.

            online: Apply the online flags.

            partialpol: Identify integrations in multi-polarisation data where part
                of the polarization products are already flagged, and flag the other
                polarization products in those integrations.

            lowtrans: Flag spectral windows for which a significant fraction of
                the channels have atmospheric transmission below the
                threshold (``mintransrepspw``, ``mintransnonrepspws``).

            mintransnonrepspws: This atmospheric transmissivity threshold is used to flag
                a non-representative science spectral window when more than 60% of
                its channels have a transmissivity below this level.

            mintransrepspw: This atmospheric transmissivity threshold is used to flag the
                representative science spectral window when more than 60% of its channels
                have a transmissivity below this level.

            fileonline: File containing the online flags. These are computed by the
                h_init or hifa_importdata data tasks. If the online flags files
                are undefined a name of the form 'msname.flagonline.txt' is assumed.

            template: Apply flagging templates

            filetemplate: The name of a text file that contains the flagging template
                for RFI, birdies, telluric lines, etc. If the template flags files
                is undefined a name of the form 'msname.flagtemplate.txt' is assumed.

            hm_tbuff: The heuristic for computing the default time interval padding
                parameter. The options are 'halfint' and 'manual'. In 'halfint' mode tbuff
                is set to half the maximum of the median integration time of the science
                and calibrator target observations. The value of 0.048 seconds is
                subtracted from the lower time limit to accommodate the behavior of the
                ALMA Control system.

            tbuff: The time in seconds used to pad flagging command time
                intervals if ``hm_tbuff`` = 'manual'. The default in
                manual mode is no flagging.

            qa0: QA0 flags.

            qa2: QA2 flags.

            parallel: Process multiple MeasurementSets in parallel using the casampi parallelization framework.

                Options: ``'automatic'``, ``'true'``, ``'false'``, ``True``, ``False``

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``False``)
