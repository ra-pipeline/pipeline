class Environment(typing.Protocol):
    """
    Environment is a Protocol that collects the attributes that describe a
    pipeline execution environment.

    This Protocol is intended to help with type safety, ensuring that
    implementations for MacOS and Linux provide all required data in the
    correct type.

    There are several bits of information collected on CPU which are
    subtly different:

    - logical_cpu_cores and physical_cpu_cores reports how many CPUs are
      present on the machine. With SMT, logical CPU cores can be more than
      the number of physical cores.
    - casa_cores and casa_threads reports how many physical and logical cores
      are accessible to the running CASA process, as detected by CASA itself.

    On a Linux machine, attributes describing the cgroup limits applied to the
    CASA process are also populated:

    - cgroup_cpus reports how many CPU cores have been allocated to the
      running process, as detected through cgroup limits.
    - cgroup_bandwidth reports the CPU bandwidth limits applied by cgroups.
      'bandwidth' means the fraction of CPU time for CPUs allocated to the
      cgroup, e.g., 25% of cores 1-4
    - casa_cores and cgroup_cpus should generally (always?) be equal, but I
      don't know enough about the CASA implementation to guarantee that.

    The most complex scenario this can describe is, for example, that CASA has
    been allocated 25% of cores 1-4 on a machine with 10 physical cores and
    14 logical cores. There are other cgroup attributes that could affect the
    amount of time CASA receives (e.g., CPU weighting), but those are ignored
    for now. We also do not attempt to detect the difference between p-cores
    and e-cores, though that may be a factor for non-cluster setups.

        A cgroup CPU Bandwidth is composed of two parts:

        - quota: the allowed time quota in microseconds for which all processes
          collectively in a child group can run during one period, or 'max' if
          no limit is applied
        - period: length of the period.

        During a single period, when processes in a control group collectively
        exhaust the time specified by this quota, they are throttled for the
        remainder of the period and not allowed to run until the next period.

        For example, a quota of 25000 and period of 100000 means that,
        collectively, the processes in this cgroup can collectively use 0.025s
        of CPU time every 0.1s.
