    """Restore flagged and calibration single dish data from a pipeline run.

    The hsd_restoredata task restores flagged and calibrated MeasurementSets
    from archived ASDMs and pipeline flagging and calibration data products.

    hsd_restoredata assumes that the ASDMs to be restored are present in the
    directory specified by the ``rawdata_dir`` (default: '../rawdata').

    By default (``copytoraw`` = True), hsd_restoredata assumes that for each
    ASDM in the input list, the corresponding pipeline flagging and calibration
    data products (in the format produced by the hsd_exportdata task) are
    present in the directory specified by ``products_dir`` (default: '../products').
    At the start of the task, these products are copied from the ``products_dir``
    to the ``rawdata_dir``.

    If ``copytoraw`` = False, hsd_restoredata assumes that these products are
    to be found in ``rawdata_dir`` along with the ASDMs.

    The expected flagging and calibration products (for each ASDM) include:

        - a compressed tar file of the final flagversions file, e.g.
          uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.ms.flagversions.tar.gz

        - a text file containing the applycal instructions, e.g.
          uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e.ms.calapply.txt

        - a compressed tar file containing the caltables for the parent session,
          e.g. uid___A001_X74_X29.session_3.caltables.tar.gz

    hsd_restoredata performs the following operations:

    - imports the ASDM(s)
    - removes the default MS.flagversions directory created by the filler
    - restores the final MS.flagversions directory stored by the pipeline
    - restores the final set of pipeline flags to the MS
    - restores the final calibration state of the MS
    - restores the final calibration tables for each MS
    - applies the calibration tables to each MS

    When importing the ASDM and converting it to a MeasurementSet (MS), if the
    output MS already exists in the output directory, then the importasdm
    conversion step is skipped, and the existing MS will be imported instead.

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Restore the pipeline results for a single ASDM in a single session

        >>> hsd_restoredata (vis=['uid___A002_X30a93d_X43e'], session=['session_1'], ocorr_mode='ao')
