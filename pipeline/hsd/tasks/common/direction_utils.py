"""
direction_utils.py: methods to convert coordinates for ephemeris sources.

Methods to convert coordinates of ephemeris sources for single-dish pipeline
are accumulated here.
For SD ephemeris sources, two types of coordinates are introduced:
'Shifted-direction' and 'Offset-direction'.
Both coodinates deal with time-by-time observing direction 
when an ephemeris source is scanned (typically with raster scan).
'Offset-direction' is a coordinate-system where the time-by-time direction 
is shifted so that the source position is centered at the origin (0 ,0)
of the RA/Dec plane. In other words, diretions of each observing point 
during the scan are calculated as the offset from the ephemeris source.
'Shifted-direction' is a coordinate-system where 
the time-by-time direction is shifted so that the source position 
is centered at 'origin' (or org_direction), 
which is where the epheris source resided on the RA/Dec plane 
at the time of the first on-source observing point in the dataset.
