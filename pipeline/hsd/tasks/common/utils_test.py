Unit tests for "hsd/tasks/common/utils.py"

Test Cases:
    1. MJD 56839.91646527777  -> 2014/7/1 21:59:42.599999
        This is a kind of boundary test that checks if the function
        property handles the date and time with microsecond accuracy.
    2. MJD 56839.91647013888  -> 2014/7/1 21:59:43.019999
        This is a test that checks if the function properly handles
        the sub-second value which is less than 0.1 where there
        are zeros after decimal point.
    3. MJD 60414              -> 2024/4/14 0:0:0.0
    4. MJD 60414.9999999999   -> 2024/4/14 23:59:59.999991
    5. MJD 60414.999999999985 -> 2024/4/14 23:59:59.999999
        These three test cases correspond to check if the bug
        reported to PIPE-2156 is fixed. As shown in the test #3,
        MJD 60414 is 2024/4/14, and it should remain the same as long
        as an integer part is 60414 (only hour/minute/second part are
        affected by the change of decimal place). However, qa.splitdate
        interpreted the values in tests #4 and #5 as 2024/4/15, which
        is obviously wrong. These tests intend to make sure the
        functions are not suffered from the bug.
