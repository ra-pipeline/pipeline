                Default: ``None`` (process all registered MeasurementSets)

            antenna: Data selection by antenna.

                Example: '1' (select by ANTENNA_ID), 'PM03' (select by antenna name), '' (all antennas)

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``''``)

            spw: Data selection by spw.

                Example: ``'3,4'`` (process spw 3 and 4), ['0','2'] (spw 0 for first data, 2 for second), ``''`` (all spws)

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``''``)

            pol: Data selection by polarizations.

                Example: ``'0'`` (process pol 0), ``['0~1','0']`` (pol 0 and 1 for first data, only 0 for second), ``''`` (all polarizations)

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``''``)

            field: Data selection by field.

                Example: ``'1'`` (select by FIELD_ID), ``'M100*'`` (select by field name), ``''`` (all fields)

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``''``)

            linewindow: Pre-defined line window. If this is set, specified line windows are used as
                a line mask for baseline subtraction instead to determine masks based on line detection and
                validation stage. Several types of format are acceptable. One is channel-based window.
                ::

                    [min_chan, max_chan]

                where min_chan and max_chan should be an integer. For multiple  windows, nested list is
                also acceptable.
                ::

                    [[min_chan0, max_chan0], [min_chan1, max_chan1], ...]

                Another way is frequency-based window.
                ::

                    [min_freq, max_freq]

                where min_freq and max_freq should be either a float or a string. If float value is given,
                it is interpreted as a frequency in Hz. String should be a quantity consisting
                of "value" and "unit", e.g., '100GHz'. Multiple windows are also supported.
                ::

                    [[min_freq0, max_freq0], [min_freq1, max_freq1], ...]

                Note that the specified frequencies are assumed to be the value in LSRK frame.
                Note also that there is a limitation when multiple MSes are processed.
                If native frequency frame of the data is not LSRK (e.g. TOPO), frequencies need to be
                converted to that frame. As a result, corresponding channel range may vary
                between MSes. However, current implementation is not able to handle such case.
                Frequencies are converted to desired frame using representative MS (time, position,
                direction).

                In the above cases, specified line windows are applied to all science spws.
                In case when line windows vary with spw, line windows can be specified by a dictionary whose
                key is spw id while value is line window. For example, the following dictionary gives different
                line windows to spws 17 and 19. Other spws, if available, will have an empty line window.
                ::

                    {17: [[100, 200], [1200, 1400]], 19: ['112115MHz', '112116MHz']}

                Furthermore, linewindow accepts MS selection string. The following string gives
                [[100,200],[1200,1400]] for spw 17 while [1000,1500] for spw 21.
                ::

                    "17:100~200;1200~1400,21:1000~1500"

                The string also accepts frequency with units. Note, however, that frequency reference frame
                in this case is not fixed to LSRK. Instead, the frame will be taken from the MS
                (typically TOPO for ALMA). Thus, the following two frequency-based line windows
                result different channel selections.
                ::

                    {19: ['112115MHz', '112116MHz']} # frequency frame is LSRK
                    "19:11215MHz~11216MHz" # frequency frame is taken from the data (TOPO for ALMA)

                None is allowed as a value of dictionary input to indicate that no line detection/validation
                is required even if manually specified line window does not exist. When None is given as a value
                and if ``linewindowmode`` is 'replace', line detection/validation is not performed
                for the corresponding spw. For example, suppose the following parameters are given for the data
                with four science spws, 17, 19, 21, and 23.
                ::

                    linewindow={17: [112.1e9, 112.2e9], 19: [113.1e9, 113.15e9], 21: None}
                    linewindowmode='replace'

                The task will use given line window for 17 and 19 while the task performs
                line deteciton/validation for spw 23 because no line window is set.
                On the other hand, line detection/validation is skipped for spw 21 due to the effect of None.

                Example: [100,200] (channel), [115e9, 115.1e9] (frequency in Hz), ['115GHz', '115.1GHz'] (see above for more examples)

                Default: None

            linewindowmode: Merge or replace given manual line window with line detection/validation result.
                If 'replace' is given, line detection and validation will not be performed.
                On the other hand, when 'merge' is specified, line detection/validation will be performed
                and manually specified line windows are added to the result.
                Note that this has no effect when linewindow for target spw is an empty list. In that case,
                line detection/validation will be performed regardless of the value of linewindowmode.
                In case if no linewindow nor line detection/validation are necessary, you should set
                linewindowmode to 'replace' and specify None as a value of the linewindow dictionary
                for the spw to apply. See parameter description of ``linewindow`` for detail.

            edge: Number of edge channels to be dropped from baseline subtraction.
                The value must be a list with length of 2, whose values specify left and right edge channels,
                respectively.

                Example: ``[10,10]``

                Default: ``None``

            broadline: Try to detect broad component of spectral line if ``True``.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``True``)

            fitfunc: Fitting function for baseline subtraction. You can choose either cubic spline
                ('spline' or 'cspline'), polynomial ('poly' or 'polynomial').

                Accepts:

                - A string: Applies the same function to all spectral windows (SPWs).
                - A dictionary: Maps SPW IDs (int or str) to a specific fitting function.

                If an SPW ID is not present in the dictionary, ``'cspline'`` will be used as the default.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``'cspline'``)

            fitorder: Fitting order for polynomial. For cubic spline, it is used to determine how
                much the spectrum is segmented into.

                Accepts:

                - An integer: Applies the same order to all SPWs. Valid values: ``-1`` (automatic), ``0``, or any positive integer.
                - A dictionary: Maps SPW IDs (int or str) to a specific fitting order.

                If an SPW ID is not present in the dictionary, ``-1`` will be used as the default, triggering automatic order selection.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``-1``)

            switchpoly: Whether to fall back the fits from cubic spline to 1st or 2nd order polynomial
                when large masks exist at the edges of the spw. Condition for switching is as follows:

                - if nmask > nchan/2      => 1st order polynomial
                - else if nmask > nchan/4 => 2nd order polynomial
                - else                    => use fitfunc and fitorder

                where nmask is a number of channels for mask at edge while
                nchan is a number of channels of entire spectral window.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``True``)

            clusteringalgorithm: Selection of the algorithm used in the clustering analysis
                to check the validity of detected line features. The 'kmean' algorithm,
                hierarchical clustering algorithm, 'hierarchy', and their combination ('both')
                are so far implemented.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``'hierarchy'``)

            deviationmask: Apply deviation mask in addition to masks determined by the automatic line detection.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``True``)

            deviationmask_sigma_threshold: Threshold factor (F) to detect the deviation.
                Actual threshold will be median + F * standard-deviation of the spectrum.

                Default: ``None`` (equivallent to ``5.0``)

            parallel: Execute using CASA HPC functionality, if available.

                Options: ``'automatic'``, ``'true'``, ``'false'``, ``True``, ``False``.

                Default: ``None`` (equivalent to ``'automatic'``).
