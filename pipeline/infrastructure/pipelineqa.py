"""
The pipelineqa module contains base classes and plugin registry for the
pipeline's QA framework.

This module contains four key classes:

    * QAScore: the base class for QA scores
    * QAScorePool: the container for lists of QAScores
    * QAPlugin: the base class for task-specific QA handlers
    * QARegistry: the registry and manager for QA plug-ins

Tasks provide and register their own QA handlers that each extends QAPlugin.
These QA handlers analyse the results of a task, in the process adding
QA scores to the Result for display in the web log.

The pipeline QA framework is activated whenever a Results instance is accepted
into the pipeline context. The pipeline QA framework operates by calling
is_handler_for(result) on each registered QAPlugin, passing it the the accepted
Results instance for inspection. QAPlugins that claim to handle the Result are
given the Result for processing. In this step, the QA framework calls
QAPlugin.handle(context, result), the method overridden by the task-specific
QAPlugin.

        The QA score is normalised to the range 0.0 to 1.0. Any score outside
        this range will be truncated at presentation time to lie within this
        range.

        The long message may be rendered on the task detail page, depending on
        whether this score is considered significant and the rendering hints

    QAPlugin is the mandatory base class for all pipeline QA handlers.

    Each pipeline tasks should create its own task-specific QA handler that
    extends QAPlugin and implements the QAPlugin.handle(context, result)
    method to perform QA analysis specific to that task. New QA handlers
    should specify which type of Results classes they process by defining the
    result_cls and child_cls class properties. If the same Results class is
    returned by multiple tasks, e.g., fluxscale and setjy, then the
    generating_task class property should also be defined, which will cause
    the handler to be activated only when the Result instance is generated by
    the specified task.

    The results structure for many pipeline tasks is to return a ResultsList
    container object that contains many task-specific Results instances, one
    per EB. Two QAPlugins must be registered for this type of task: one to
    process the per-EB Results leaf objects, and another to process the
    containing ResultsList, pulling up the QA scores on each per-EB Result
    into the ResultsList's QAScorePool and setting a representative score.
    This can be achieved with two new QAPlugins, e.g.,

        # This will process the per-EB results
        MyTaskQAPlugin(QAHandler):
            result_cls = MyTaskResults
            child_cls = None

        # This will process the container
        MyTaskContainerQAPlugin(QAHandler):
            result_cls =ResultsList
            child_cls = MyTaskResults

    Within QAPlugin.handle(context, result), a QA Handler can analyse, modify,
    or make additions to the Results instances in any way it sees fit. In
    practice, the standard modification is to create and add one or more new
    QAScore instances to the QAScorePool attribute of the Result.

    Extending the QAPlugin base class automatically registers the subclass with
    with the pipeline QA framework. However, QAPlugin must be explicitly
    extended, and not implicitly inherited via another subclass of QAPlugin.
    Put another way, if class Foo extends QAPlugin, and class Bar extends Foo,
    only Foo is registered with the QA framework. To register Bar, the class
    definition must use multiple inheritance, e.g., 'class Bar(Foo, QAPlugin):'.
