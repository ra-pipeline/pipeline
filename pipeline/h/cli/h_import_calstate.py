    """Import a calibration state from disk.

    h_import_calstate clears and then recreates the pipeline calibration state
    based on the set of applycal calls given in the named file. The applycal
    statements are interpreted in additive fashion; for identically specified
    data selection targets, caltables specified in later statements will be added
    to the state created by earlier calls.

    Args:
        filename: Name of the saved calibration state

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Import a calibration state from disk.
