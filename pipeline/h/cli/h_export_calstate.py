def h_export_calstate(filename=None, state=None):
    """Save the pipeline calibration state to disk.

    h_export_calstate saves the current pipeline calibration state to disk
    in the form of a set of equivalent applycal calls.

    If ``filename`` is not given, h_export_calstate saves the calibration state to
    disk with a filename based on the pipeline context creation time, using the
    extension '.calstate'

    One of two calibration states can be exported: either the active calibration
    state (those calibrations currently applied on-the-fly but scheduled for
    permanent application to the MeasurementSet in a subsequent hif_applycal
    call) or the applied calibration state (calibrations that were previously
    applied to the MeasurementSet using hif_applycal). The default is to export
    the active calibration state.

    Args:
        filename: Name for saved calibration state.

        state: The calibration state to export. If undefined, the active
            calibration state will be exported. If set to 'applied', the
            applied calibration state will be exported instead.

    Returns:
        The results object for the pipeline task is returned.

    Examples:
        1. Save the calibration state:

        >>> h_export_calstate()

        2. Save the active calibration state with a custom filename:

        >>> h_export_calstate(filename='afterbandpass.calstate')

        3. Save the applied calibration state with a custom filename:

        >>> h_export_calstate(filename='applied.calstate', state='applied')
